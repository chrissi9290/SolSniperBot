  <h1>SOLPRINTER PONZI FAQ</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🚀 How Does the Hourly Payout Work in SOLPRINTER PONZI?</h2>
        <p>SOLPRINTER PONZI uses an automatic distribution system, where transaction fees are redistributed as <span class="highlight">SOLANA (SOL)</span> to all token holders every hour – with no manual claiming required!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔹 Where Do the Fees for the Payout Come From?</h2>
        <p>Every transaction with the SOLPRINTER PONZI ($SPP) Token generates a transaction fee. This fee is structured to directly benefit token holders.</p>
        <p>Fees are collected from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1️⃣ <strong>Buying & Selling $SPP Tokens</strong> – Every time someone buys or sells SOLPRINTER PONZI, a fee is charged.</li>
            <li>2️⃣ <strong>The 6% Buy Fee</strong> – Each purchase contributes to liquidity and prevents sniper bots.</li>
            <li>3️⃣ <strong>The 100% Sell Tax</strong> – This tax is fully used for payouts and goes directly to the community & project development.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔹 How Are Rewards Distributed to Holders?</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">75% of transaction fees</span> are distributed directly to all token holders as SOLANA (SOL).</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">25% of fees</span> go toward project development, marketing, and future expansion.</p>
        <p>The more transactions occur, the higher the SOL rewards for each holder.</p>
        <p>👉 This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The more people buy & sell $SPP, the more SOL you receive every hour!</li>
            <li>The more $SPP you hold, the larger your share of the rewards!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔹 Why an Hourly Payout?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ <strong>Automatic Rewards:</strong> No need for manual staking or farming. Rewards go directly to your wallet!</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Long-Term Stability:</strong> Regular payouts encourage an active community and continuous transactions.</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Anti-Sniper Bot Protection:</strong> The 1-hour holding period prevents bots from gaining unfair advantages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short: The more you hold, the more you earn – completely passively! 🚀💰</p>

        <h2>🔹 Why Is the SOLPRINTER PONZI Airdrop Worth It?</h2>
        <p>An airdrop is an opportunity to receive tokens for free or at a discount before they are fully traded on the market. The SOLPRINTER PONZI Airdrop gives you a chance to get in early before major trading begins!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔥 The Benefits of the SOLPRINTER PONZI Airdrop</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ <strong>Early Participation</strong> – You receive $SPP before the main sale starts, giving you a head start and benefiting from early price increases.</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Lower Entry Price</strong> – Compared to buying later on a decentralized exchange (DEX), you get tokens at the best possible price.</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Higher Rewards for Holding Early</strong> – Since you hold the tokens before everyone else, you start receiving hourly SOL rewards from transaction fees right away!</li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Deflationary Mechanism</strong> – All unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned. This means:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fewer available tokens → Higher demand → Rising value!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>✅ <strong>Anti-Bot Protection & Community Rewards</strong> – Since the airdrop requires a minimum holding period of one hour, it prevents sniper bots from buying and dumping quickly. Real investors benefit more!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🚀 How to Participate in the Airdrop?</h2>

        <h2>💎 What Is Liquidity & How Does It Determine the Price of SOLPRINTER PONZI?</h2>
        <p>Liquidity is a key concept in cryptocurrency trading. It determines how easily and stably a token can be bought and sold without drastic price changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔹 What Does “Liquidity” Mean in a Liquidity Pool?</h2>
        <p>In decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Raydium or Orca on Solana, there are no central market makers like in traditional exchanges. Instead, the token price is set by an automated market maker (AMM).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>Liquidity Pool (LP)</strong> is a smart contract that contains two different tokens (e.g., SOL and $SPP).</li>
            <li>Every transaction (buy or sell) uses this pool to swap tokens.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pool ensures there are always enough tokens available for trading and that the price adjusts dynamically to supply & demand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔹 How Does Liquidity Determine the Price?</h2>
        <p>The token price is set by a mathematical model in the liquidity pool:</p>
        <p>🛒 <strong>More buyers than sellers</strong> = Price goes up!</p>
        <p>📉 <strong>More sellers than buyers</strong> = Price goes down!</p>
        <p>The ratio of SOL to $SPP in the pool decides the price:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If many people buy SOLPRINTER PONZI, the amount of SOL in the pool increases, and the amount of $SPP decreases → <strong>The price rises!</strong></li>
            <li>If many people sell $SPP, the amount of SOL in the pool decreases, and the amount of $SPP increases → <strong>The price drops!</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>🔹 More Liquidity = More Stable Price!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>🔹 Less Liquidity = Higher Price Volatility!</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔹 How Does SOLPRINTER PONZI Use Liquidity?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1️⃣ <strong>50% of the Token Supply</strong> is provided for liquidity
                <ul>
                    <li>This ensures a stable price base and smooth transactions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2️⃣ <strong>Liquidity is permanently burned 🔥</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This means no one can remove the liquidity, making Rug Pulls (exit scams) impossible!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>3️⃣ <strong>Every transaction contributes to liquidity</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 6% buy fee ensures there are always enough funds for trading.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>💡 Conclusion:</strong> Liquidity is the foundation of a stable coin. The larger the liquidity pool, the more stable the price, and the safer your investment! 🚀💰</p>
